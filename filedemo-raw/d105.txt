(henry4p1 5:4) henry5: O God! they did me too much injury
[p]That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
[p]If it were so, I might have let alone
[p]The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
[p]Which would have been as speedy in your end
[p]As all the poisonous potions in the world
[p]And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
