(kinglear 1:1) lear: Then leave her, sir; for, by the pow'r that made me,
[p]I tell you all her wealth. [To France] For you, great King,
[p]I would not from your love make such a stray
[p]To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
[p]T' avert your liking a more worthier way
[p]Than on a wretch whom nature is asham'd
[p]Almost t' acknowledge hers.
