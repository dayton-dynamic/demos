(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,
[p]As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.
[p]Were never four such lamps together mix'd,
[p]Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
[p]But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,
[p]Shone like the moon in water seen by night.
