(sonnets 1:146) Poet: Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
[p][         ] these rebel powers that thee array;
[p]Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
[p]Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
[p]Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
[p]Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
[p]Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
[p]Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
[p]Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
[p]And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
[p]Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
[p]Within be fed, without be rich no more:
[p]  So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
[p]  And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.
