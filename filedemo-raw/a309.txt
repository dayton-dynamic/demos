(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
[p]She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
[p]But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;
[p]Till after many accents and delays,
[p]Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
[p]She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,
[p]That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'
