(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: 'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!
[p]O, never let their crimson liveries wear!
[p]And as they last, their verdure still endure,
[p]To drive infection from the dangerous year!
[p]That the star-gazers, having writ on death,
[p]May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
