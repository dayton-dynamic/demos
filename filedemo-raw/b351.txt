(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: 'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,
[p]Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:
[p]Before I know myself, seek not to know me;
[p]No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:
[p]The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
[p]Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.
