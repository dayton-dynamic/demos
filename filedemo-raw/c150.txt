(kingjohn 3:1) Constance: War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
[p]O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
[p]That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
[p]Thou little valiant, great in villany!
[p]Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
[p]Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
[p]But when her humorous ladyship is by
[p]To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
[p]And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
[p]A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
[p]Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
[p]Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
[p]Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
[p]Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
[p]And dost thou now fall over to my fores?
[p]Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
[p]And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
