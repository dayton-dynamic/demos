(henry8 5:3) Cranmer: My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
[p]Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
[p]And with no little study, that my teaching
[p]And the strong course of my authority
[p]Might go one way, and safely; and the end
[p]Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
[p]I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
[p]A man that more detests, more stirs against,
[p]Both in his private conscience and his place,
[p]Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
[p]Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
[p]With less allegiance in it! Men that make
[p]Envy and crooked malice nourishment
[p]Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
[p]That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
[p]Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
[p]And freely urge against me.
