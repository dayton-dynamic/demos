(kingjohn 3:1) kingjohn: Though you and all the kings of Christendom
[p]Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
[p]Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
[p]And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
[p]Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
[p]Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
[p]Though you and all the rest so grossly led
[p]This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
[p]Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
[p]Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
