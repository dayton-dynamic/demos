(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide
[p]In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood
[p]Circles her body in on every side,
[p]Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood
[p]Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
[p]Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,
[p]And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.
