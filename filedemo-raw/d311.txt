(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,
[p]Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;
[p]Till Lucrece' father, that beholds her bleed,
[p]Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;
[p]And from the purple fountain Brutus drew
[p]The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,
[p]Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
