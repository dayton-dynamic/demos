(kinglear 1:1) cordelia: I yet beseech your Majesty,
[p]If for I want that glib and oily art
[p]To speak and purpose not, since what I well intend,
[p]I'll do't before I speak- that you make known
[p]It is no vicious blot, murther, or foulness,
[p]No unchaste action or dishonoured step,
[p]That hath depriv'd me of your grace and favour;
[p]But even for want of that for which I am richer-
[p]A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
[p]As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
[p]Hath lost me in your liking.
