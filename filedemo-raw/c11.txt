(12night 1:5) FESTE: Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
[p]Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
[p]prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
[p]pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
[p]'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
[p][Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO]
[p]God bless thee, lady!
