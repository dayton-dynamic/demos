(kingjohn 3:1) kingjohn: What earthy name to interrogatories
[p]Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
[p]Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
[p]So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
[p]To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
[p]Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
[p]Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
[p]Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
[p]But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
[p]So under Him that great supremacy,
[p]Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
[p]Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
[p]So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
[p]To him and his usurp'd authority.
