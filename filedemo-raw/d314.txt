(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: 'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,
[p]'That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
[p]If in the child the father's image lies,
[p]Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?
[p]Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
[p]If children predecease progenitors,
[p]We are their offspring, and they none of ours.
