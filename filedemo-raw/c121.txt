(henry5 5:2) Chorus-h5: Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,
[p]Our bending author hath pursued the story,
[p]In little room confining mighty men,
[p]Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
[p]Small time, but in that small most greatly lived
[p]This star of England: Fortune made his sword;
[p]By which the world's best garden be achieved,
[p]And of it left his son imperial lord.
[p]Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King
[p]Of France and England, did this king succeed;
[p]Whose state so many had the managing,
[p]That they lost France and made his England bleed:
[p]Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,
[p]In your fair minds let this acceptance take.
