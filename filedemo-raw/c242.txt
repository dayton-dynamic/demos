(midsummer 4:1) Theseus: Go, one of you, find out the forester;
[p]For now our observation is perform'd;
[p]And since we have the vaward of the day,
[p]My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
[p]Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
[p]Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
[p][Exit an Attendant]
[p]We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
[p]And mark the musical confusion
[p]Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
