(henry8 5:3) Gardiner: My lord, because we have business of more moment,
[p]We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,
[p]And our consent, for better trial of you,
[p]From hence you be committed to the Tower;
[p]Where, being but a private man again,
[p]You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
[p]More than, I fear, you are provided for.
