(sonnets 1:147) Poet: My love is as a fever, longing still
[p]For that which longer nurseth the disease,
[p]Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
[p]The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
[p]My reason, the physician to my love,
[p]Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
[p]Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
[p]Desire is death, which physic did except.
[p]Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
[p]And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
[p]My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
[p]At random from the truth vainly express'd;
[p]  For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,
[p]  Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.
