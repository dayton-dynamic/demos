(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: 'Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;
[p]If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'
[p]'Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'
[p]The honey fee of parting tender'd is:
[p]Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
[p]Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.
