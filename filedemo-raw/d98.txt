(henry4p1 3:1) hotspur: I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
[p]With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
[p]Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
[p]And of a dragon and a finless fish,
[p]A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
[p]A couching lion and a ramping cat,
[p]And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
[p]As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
[p]He held me last night at least nine hours
[p]In reckoning up the several devils' names
[p]That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
[p]But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
[p]As a tired horse, a railing wife;
[p]Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
[p]With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
[p]Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
[p]In any summer-house in Christendom.
