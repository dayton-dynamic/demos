(henry6p1 1:1) Gloucester: England ne'er had a king until his time.
[p]Virtue he had, deserving to command:
[p]His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
[p]His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
[p]His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
[p]More dazzled and drove back his enemies
[p]Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
[p]What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
[p]He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
