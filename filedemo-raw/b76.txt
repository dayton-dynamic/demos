(hamlet 5:2) fortinbras: Let four captains
[p]Bear Hamlet like a soldier to the stage;
[p]For he was likely, had he been put on,
[p]To have prov'd most royally; and for his passage
[p]The soldiers' music and the rites of war
[p]Speak loudly for him.
[p]Take up the bodies. Such a sight as this
[p]Becomes the field but here shows much amiss.
[p]Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
