(henry4p1 3:1) hotspur: Marry,
[p]And I am glad of it with all my heart:
[p]I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
[p]Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
[p]I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
[p]Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
[p]And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
[p]Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
[p]'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
