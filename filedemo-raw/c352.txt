(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: 'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,
[p]His day's hot task hath ended in the west;
[p]The owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''Tis very late;'
[p]The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,
[p]And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light
[p]Do summon us to part and bid good night.
