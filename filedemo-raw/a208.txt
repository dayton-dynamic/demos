(merchantvenice 1:3) Shylock: This kindness will I show.
[p]Go with me to a notary, seal me there
[p]Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
[p]If you repay me not on such a day,
[p]In such a place, such sum or sums as are
[p]Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
[p]Be nominated for an equal pound
[p]Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
[p]In what part of your body pleaseth me.
