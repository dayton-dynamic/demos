(muchado 2:1) donpedro: And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
[p]I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
[p]strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
[p]will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
[p]shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
[p]two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
[p]despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
[p]shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
[p]Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
[p]ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
[p]and I will tell you my drift.
