(sonnets 1:148) Poet: O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
[p]Which have no correspondence with true sight!
[p]Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
[p]That censures falsely what they see aright?
[p]If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
[p]What means the world to say it is not so?
[p]If it be not, then love doth well denote
[p]Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'
[p]How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,
[p]That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
[p]No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
[p]The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
[p]  O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
[p]  Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.
