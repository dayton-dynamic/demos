(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: 'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,
[p]What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?
[p]To sell myself I can be well contented,
[p]So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;
[p]Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
[p]Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.
