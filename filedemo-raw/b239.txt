(merchantvenice 4:1) Portia-mv: The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
[p]It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
[p]Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
[p]It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
[p]'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
[p]The throned monarch better than his crown;
[p]His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
[p]The attribute to awe and majesty,
[p]Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
[p]But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
[p]It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
[p]It is an attribute to God himself;
[p]And earthly power doth then show likest God's
[p]When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
[p]Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
[p]That, in the course of justice, none of us
[p]Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
[p]And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
[p]The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
[p]To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
[p]Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
[p]Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
