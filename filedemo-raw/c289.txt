(pericles 2:5) Pericles: [Aside] What's here?
[p]A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
[p]'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
[p]O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
[p]A stranger and distressed gentleman,
[p]That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,
[p]But bent all offices to honour her.
