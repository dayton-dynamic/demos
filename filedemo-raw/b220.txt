(merchantvenice 2:1) Portia-mv: In terms of choice I am not solely led
[p]By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
[p]Besides, the lottery of my destiny
[p]Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
[p]But if my father had not scanted me
[p]And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
[p]His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
[p]Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
[p]As any comer I have look'd on yet
[p]For my affection.
