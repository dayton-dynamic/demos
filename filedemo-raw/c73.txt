(hamlet 5:2) horatio: Not from his mouth,
[p]Had it th' ability of life to thank you.
[p]He never gave commandment for their death.
[p]But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
[p]You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
[p]Are here arriv'd, give order that these bodies
[p]High on a stage be placed to the view;
[p]And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
[p]How these things came about. So shall you hear
[p]Of carnal, bloody and unnatural acts;
[p]Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters;
[p]Of deaths put on by cunning and forc'd cause;
[p]And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
[p]Fall'n on th' inventors' heads. All this can I
[p]Truly deliver.
