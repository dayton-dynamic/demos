(muchado 2:2) borachio: Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
[p]the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
[p]that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
[p]prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
[p]honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
[p]reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
[p]semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
[p]thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
[p]offer them instances; which shall bear no less
[p]likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
[p]hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
[p]Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
[p]before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
[p]will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
[p]absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
[p]of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
[p]assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
