(kinglear 1:1) lear: Right noble Burgundy,
[p]When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
[p]But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands.
[p]If aught within that little seeming substance,
[p]Or all of it, with our displeasure piec'd,
[p]And nothing more, may fitly like your Grace,
[p]She's there, and she is yours.
