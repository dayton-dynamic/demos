(kingjohn 3:1) CardinalPandulph: Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
[p]To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
[p]I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
[p]And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
[p]Do in his name religiously demand
[p]Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
[p]So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
[p]Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
[p]Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
[p]This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
[p]Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
