(coriolanus 2:2) SecondOfficer-cor: He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
[p]ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
[p]having been supple and courteous to the people,
[p]bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
[p]an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
[p]planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
[p]in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
[p]silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
[p]ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
[p]malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
[p]reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
