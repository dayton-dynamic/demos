(kinglear 1:1) kingfrance-kl: This is most strange,
[p]That she that even but now was your best object,
[p]The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
[p]Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
[p]Commit a thing so monstrous to dismantle
[p]So many folds of favour. Sure her offence
[p]Must be of such unnatural degree
[p]That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
[p]Fall'n into taint; which to believe of her
[p]Must be a faith that reason without miracle
[p]Should never plant in me.
