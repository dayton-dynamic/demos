(henry6p1 1:1) bedford: Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
[p]Comets, importing change of times and states,
[p]Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
[p]And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
[p]That have consented unto Henry's death!
[p]King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
[p]England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
