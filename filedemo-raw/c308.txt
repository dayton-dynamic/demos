(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: With this, they all at once began to say,
[p]Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
[p]While with a joyless smile she turns away
[p]The face, that map which deep impression bears
[p]Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
[p]'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living,
[p]By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.'
