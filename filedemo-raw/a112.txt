(henry4p1 5:4) henry5: Why, then I see
[p]A very valiant rebel of the name.
[p]I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
[p]To share with me in glory any more:
[p]Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
[p]Nor can one England brook a double reign,
[p]Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
