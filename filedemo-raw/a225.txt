(merchantvenice 4:1) Clerk-mv: [Reads]
[p]Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
[p]your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
[p]your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
[p]me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
[p]acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
[p]the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
[p]many books together: he is furnished with my
[p]opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
[p]greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
[p]with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
[p]request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
[p]years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
[p]estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
[p]old a head. I leave him to your gracious
[p]acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
[p]commendation.
