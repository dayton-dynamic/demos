(sonnets 1:144) Poet: Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
[p]Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
[p]The better angel is a man right fair,
[p]The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
[p]To win me soon to hell, my female evil
[p]Tempteth my better angel from my side,
[p]And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
[p]Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
[p]And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
[p]Suspect I may, but not directly tell;
[p]But being both from me, both to each friend,
[p]I guess one angel in another's hell:
[p]  Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
[p]  Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
