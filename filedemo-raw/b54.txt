(coriolanus 2:1) Messenger-cor: You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
[p]That CORIOLANUS shall be consul:
[p]I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
[p]The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
[p]Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
[p]Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
[p]As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
[p]A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
[p]I never saw the like.
