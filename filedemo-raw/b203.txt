(loveslabours 2:1) Ferdinand: It shall suffice me: at which interview
[p]All liberal reason I will yield unto.
[p]Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
[p]As honour without breach of honour may
[p]Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
[p]You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
[p]But here without you shall be so received
[p]As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
[p]Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
[p]Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
[p]To-morrow shall we visit you again.
