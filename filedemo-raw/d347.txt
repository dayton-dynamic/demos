(venusadonis 1:1) Poet: 'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again:
[p]Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,
[p]Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
[p]That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;
[p]And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
[p]But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.
