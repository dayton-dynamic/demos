(loveslabours 2:1) Ferdinand: Madam, your father here doth intimate
[p]The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
[p]Being but the one half of an entire sum
[p]Disbursed by my father in his wars.
[p]But say that he or we, as neither have,
[p]Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
[p]A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
[p]One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
[p]Although not valued to the money's worth.
[p]If then the king your father will restore
[p]But that one half which is unsatisfied,
[p]We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
[p]And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
[p]But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
[p]For here he doth demand to have repaid
[p]A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
[p]On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
[p]To have his title live in Aquitaine;
[p]Which we much rather had depart withal
[p]And have the money by our father lent
[p]Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
[p]Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
[p]From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
[p]A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
[p]And go well satisfied to France again.
