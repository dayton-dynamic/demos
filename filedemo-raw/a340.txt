(timonathens 4:3) Timon: Rogue, rogue, rogue!
[p]I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
[p]But even the mere necessities upon 't.
[p]Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
[p]Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
[p]Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
[p]That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
[p][To the gold]
[p]O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
[p]'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
[p]Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
[p]Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
[p]Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
[p]That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
[p]That solder'st close impossibilities,
[p]And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
[p]every tongue,
[p]To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
[p]Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
[p]Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
[p]May have the world in empire!
