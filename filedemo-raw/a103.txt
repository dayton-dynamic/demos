[p]Never to hold it up again! the spirits
[p]Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
[p]It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
[p]Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
[p][They fight: DOUGLAS flies]
[p]Cheerly, my lord. how fares your grace?
[p]Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
[p]And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
