(henry6p1 1:1) exeter: We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
[p]Henry is dead and never shall revive:
[p]Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
[p]And death's dishonourable victory
[p]We with our stately presence glorify,
[p]Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
[p]What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
[p]That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
[p]Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
[p]Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him
[p]By magic verses have contrived his end?
