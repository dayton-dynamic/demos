(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: About the mourning and congealed face
[p]Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,
[p]Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:
[p]And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,
[p]Corrupted blood some watery token shows;
[p]And blood untainted still doth red abide,
[p]Blushing at that which is so putrified.
