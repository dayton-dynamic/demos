(coriolanus 2:2) SecondOfficer-cor: Faith, there had been many great men that have
[p]flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
[p]be many that they have loved, they know not
[p]wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
[p]they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
[p]Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
[p]him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
[p]disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
[p]them plainly see't.
