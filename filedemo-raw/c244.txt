(midsummer 4:1) Theseus: My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
[p]So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
[p]With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
[p]Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
[p]Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
[p]Each under each. A cry more tuneable
[p]Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
[p]In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
[p]Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
