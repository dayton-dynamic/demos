(sonnets 1:145) Poet: Those lips that Love's own hand did make
[p]Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
[p]To me that languish'd for her sake;
[p]But when she saw my woeful state,
[p]Straight in her heart did mercy come,
[p]Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
[p]Was used in giving gentle doom,
[p]And taught it thus anew to greet:
[p]'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
[p]That follow'd it as gentle day
[p]Doth follow night, who like a fiend
[p]From heaven to hell is flown away;
[p]  'I hate' from hate away she threw,
[p]  And saved my life, saying 'not you.'
