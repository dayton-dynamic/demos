(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: At this request, with noble disposition
[p]Each present lord began to promise aid,
[p]As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
[p]Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.
[p]But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,
[p]The protestation stops. 'O, speak, ' quoth she,
[p]'How may this forced stain be wiped from me?
