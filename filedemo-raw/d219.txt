(merchantvenice 2:1) PrinceMorocco: Mislike me not for my complexion,
[p]The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
[p]To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
[p]Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
[p]Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
[p]And let us make incision for your love,
[p]To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
[p]I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
[p]Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
[p]The best-regarded virgins of our clime
[p]Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
[p]Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
