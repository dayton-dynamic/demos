(merchantvenice 1:3) Shylock: O father Abram, what these Christians are,
[p]Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
[p]The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
[p]If he should break his day, what should I gain
[p]By the exaction of the forfeiture?
[p]A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
[p]Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
[p]As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
[p]To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
[p]If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
[p]And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
