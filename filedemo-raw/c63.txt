(coriolanus 2:2) FirstOfficer-cor: If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
[p]he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
[p]good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
[p]devotion than can render it him; and leaves
[p]nothing undone that may fully discover him their
[p]opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
[p]displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
[p]dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
