(henry8 5:3) Cranmer: Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
[p]You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
[p]I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
[p]You are so merciful: I see your end;
[p]'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,
[p]Become a churchman better than ambition:
[p]Win straying souls with modesty again,
[p]Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
[p]Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
[p]I make as little doubt, as you do conscience
[p]In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
[p]But reverence to your calling makes me modest.
