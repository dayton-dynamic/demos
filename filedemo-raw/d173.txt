(kinglear 1:1) kingfrance-kl: Is it but this- a tardiness in nature
[p]Which often leaves the history unspoke
[p]That it intends to do? My Lord of Burgundy,
[p]What say you to the lady? Love's not love
[p]When it is mingled with regards that stands
[p]Aloof from th' entire point. Will you have her?
[p]She is herself a dowry.
