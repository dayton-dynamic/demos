(12night 1:5) FESTE: Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
[p]will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
[p]the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
[p]himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
[p]he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
[p]that's mended is but patched: virtue that
[p]transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
[p]amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
[p]simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
[p]what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
[p]calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
[p]away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
