(henry4p1 1:1) henry4: So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
[p]Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
[p]And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
[p]To be commenced in strands afar remote.
[p]No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
[p]Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
[p]Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
[p]Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
[p]Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
[p]Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
[p]All of one nature, of one substance bred,
[p]Did lately meet in the intestine shock
[p]And furious close of civil butchery
[p]Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
[p]March all one way and be no more opposed
[p]Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
[p]The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
[p]No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
[p]As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
[p]Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
[p]We are impressed and engaged to fight,
[p]Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
[p]Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
[p]To chase these pagans in those holy fields
[p]Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
[p]Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
[p]For our advantage on the bitter cross.
[p]But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
[p]And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
[p]Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
[p]Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
[p]What yesternight our council did decree
[p]In forwarding this dear expedience.
