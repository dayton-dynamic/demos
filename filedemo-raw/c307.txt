(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: 'What is the quality of mine offence,
[p]Being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance?
[p]May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,
[p]My low-declined honour to advance?
[p]May any terms acquit me from this chance?
[p]The poison'd fountain clears itself again;
[p]And why not I from this compelled stain?'
