(rapelucrece 1:2) Poet: Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
[p]A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed:
[p]That blow did that it from the deep unrest
[p]Of that polluted prison where it breathed:
[p]Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
[p]Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly
[p]Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny.
