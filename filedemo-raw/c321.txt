(timonathens 4:3) Timon: A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
[p]attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
[p]beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
[p]eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
[p]suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
[p]the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
[p]torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
[p]breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
[p]greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
[p]hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
[p]unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
[p]make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
[p]thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
[p]wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
[p]leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
[p]the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
[p]thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
[p]defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
[p]were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
[p]thou already, that seest not thy loss in
[p]transformation!
