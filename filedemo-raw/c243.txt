(midsummer 4:1) Hippolyta: I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
[p]When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
[p]With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
[p]Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
[p]The skies, the fountains, every region near
[p]Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
[p]So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
