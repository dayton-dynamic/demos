(midsummer 4:1) Lysander: My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
[p]Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
[p]I cannot truly say how I came here;
[p]But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
[p]And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
[p]I came with Hermia hither: our intent
[p]Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
[p]Without the peril of the Athenian law.
